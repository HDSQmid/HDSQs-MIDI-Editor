HDSQ's MIDI Editor
	Guide to contributing
******************************


If there's a feature you want to see in this program, and you know some programming, 
it would be great if you helped me make it.


You might want to familiarise yourself with the way that the application is organised.

To put it simply, I haven't even finished Alpha 1 yet and its already more than 2000 lines 
spread over more than 10 source files, so it might take some getting used to.

***********************************************************************

				Here's a nice little list that tells you how the source is organised

MIDI Editor.cpp - main source file, contains basic application functions. Basically nothing is here.

midiLib.h - will contain functions and classes needed to edit MIDIs, including patterns, tracks, notes and the encapsulating class, Midi
	files.h - will contain functions and classes for containing files, as well as opening and saving them
			including saving .hqp files and exporting .mid files
these files are currently incomplete

multiLingual.h - contains functions and classes needed to provide translations to anything that is sent as output
	languageDefinitions.h - contains #defines of everything the program says as well as integer codes used by these
			this file is edited anytime the application needs to say something new
	.lang files - contain the integers mentioned above and then their corresponding translations for that language

console_io_handler.h - contains handlers for console input

messageSend.h - contains functions for sending messages to the user. currently only supports console output, but eventually Qt will be used to create a GUI.
			this also contains functions for getting responses from the user.

settings.h - contains the class for configuring the application

I hope that this helps anyone that wants to contribute
