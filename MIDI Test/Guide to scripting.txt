	Guide to scripting
*************************************

Scripting will eventually be able to be used to automate boring tasks for example, duplicating a pattern a million times or something

It works with text files containing console input, line by line.
Eventually, basic looping will be added, and maybe other stuff

I'm currently considering adding scripts in a language such as Lua, but I might need help with this

Basically type stuff into the text file that you would type into the console and it should work
